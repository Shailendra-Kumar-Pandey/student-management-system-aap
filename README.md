📘 Project Description: Student Management System
Project Name: Student Management System
Technologies Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Node.js
Database: JSON File (used as a backend database)

📌 Project Overview
The Student Management System is a simple and efficient web application created to manage student information.
It allows users to add, update, delete, and search student details such as Name, Email, Class, and Mobile Number.

The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The backend is developed using Node.js, and all data is stored in a JSON file, which acts as a lightweight database.

This project is perfect for learning backend concepts, CRUD operations, and connecting frontend with backend.

🎯 Key Features
✔️ 1. Add New Student
Users can add new student details through a form.
The data is saved in a JSON file using Node.js.
✔️ 2. View Student List
All students are displayed in a clean table format.
Data is loaded from the JSON file via the backend.
✔️ 3. Search Student
Users can search for any student by name, email, class, or mobile number.
If the student does not exist, a proper message is shown.
✔️ 4. Update Student Information
Existing student details can be updated.
Updated data is saved back into the JSON file.
✔️ 5. Delete Student
Users can delete any student permanently.
After deleting, the JSON file is updated.
✔️ 6. JSON File as Database
Instead of using MySQL or MongoDB, a JSON file is used as a simple database.
This helps beginners understand how backend data handling works.

🛠️ Technologies Explained
Frontend
HTML → Page structure
CSS → Styling and layout
JavaScript → Dynamic actions, form validation, API calls

Backend
Node.js →
Handles API routes
Reads and writes data to JSON file
Performs Create, Read, Update, Delete operations

Database
students.json → Stores all student data in an array of objects

🚀 How the System Works (Flow)
1. User opens the web page
2. User performs actions (Add, Search, Update, Delete)
3. Frontend sends request to Node.js backend
4. Backend reads/writes the JSON file
5. Backend sends response back to frontend
6. The page updates dynamically

🎉 Conclusion
The Student Management System is a perfect project to understand how full-stack applications work.
It includes all major features like Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations using a real backend.
